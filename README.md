# [Nexcess.net](https://www.nexcess.net/) Two Factor Authentication Extension for Magento
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nexcess/magento-two-factor-auth.png?branch=master,devel)](https://travis-ci.org/nexcess/magento-two-factor-auth)

2 Factor Auth is an extension to provide [two factor authentication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication) for [Magento](https://www.magentocommerce.com/), via third-party authentication providers. Two factor authentication provides additional security beyond the default username and password that Magento requires (something the user *knows*) by also requiring a time sensitive passcode, generated from an app on the user's smartphone (something the user *has*).

**NOTE** This extension is brand new and not yet ready for production use.

## Features (planned)

  * Multiple service providers: Google, Duo, possibly others
  * Easy installation and set-up
  * Maybe some other stuff (TODO: maybe remove this section)

## Requirements

  * Magento Community Edition 1.6+ or Enterprise Edition 1.11+ (TODO: this is arbitrary)

## Installation & Usage

TODO: Links to the relevant wiki pages when they get created.

## Support

If you have an issue, please read the [FAQ](https://github.com/nexcess/magento-two-factor-auth/wiki/FAQ) then if you still need help, open a bug report in GitHub's
[issue tracker](https://github.com/nexcess/magento-two-factor-auth/issues).

Please do not use Magento Connect's Reviews or (especially) the Q&A for support.
There isn't a way for me to reply to reviews and the Q&A moderation is very slow.
